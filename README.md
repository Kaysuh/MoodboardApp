Mood board APP

- A enviroment for users to create, view and share mood boards.

This project is aimed at making it easier to find specific moods by searching based on
tags, titles, colors etc. To find the exact mood one is looking for. This can be thought of as
a more specific version of pinterest where you can see what other users have made and contribute yourself, or
just make mood boards for yourself without sharing.
